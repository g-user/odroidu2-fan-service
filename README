This is a small C project for the ODROID-U2 Platform by Hardkernel.

This will behave like a service running on background.

It will check the current SoC temperature and based on that, set the FAN PWM controller on U2.

By default it understands that the maximum cpu temperature that can be achieved without throttle is 85C,
so, knowning that we setted a limit of 80C where at 80C fan speed will be at max.
